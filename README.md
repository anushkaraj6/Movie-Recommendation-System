# Movie-Recommendation-System

A movie recommendation system, also known as a movie recommender system, is a machine learning-based method of filtering or predicting users' preferences for films based on their prior preferences and activities. It is a cutting-edge filtration system that anticipates user preferences and potential movie selections for a certain domain-specific item, in this case movies.
Movie recommendation systems are basically of three types:
-	Content Based Recommendation System - According to the user's past actions or explicit feedback, content-based filtering uses item features to suggest additional articles that are similar to what they already enjoy.
-	Popularity Based Recommendation System - It is a form of recommendation system that operates on the concept of popularity and/or anything that is in trend. These technologies determine which movies are most in demand or well-liked by people and then immediately recommend them.
-	Collaborative Based Recommendation System - Here, information is filtered by collaborative filtering using other users' interactions and system-collected data. It is predicated on the notion that individuals who agreed in their judgement of particular movies are likely to agree once more in the future.

This recommendation system is based on popularity.
